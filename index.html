          The Palace is the oldest, largest and best preserved surviving example
          of traditional wooden architecture in Jimma. It is a fusion of
          traditional building technology from south-western Ethiopia and the
          Indo-Arab architectural style, which was common in settlements around
          the Indian Ocean.
